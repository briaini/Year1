First group project.
I was team leader for this project and wrote the main, analyseCharacterContent, and determineIfPalindromes methods.


Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user. Analyze the vowel content of this input, reporting:
•whether or not the input contains no vowels 
•whether or not the input contains all the vowels in any order 
•whether or not the input contains all the vowels in alphabetical order
•whether or not the input contains all the vowels in reverse alphabetical order
•the frequency of each vowel in the input, only for those vowels for which there is at least one occurrence in the input. 

Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user. Analyze the consonant content of this input, reporting:
•the frequency of each consonant in the input, only for those consonants for which there is at least one occurrence in the input. 

Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user. Analyze the character content of this input, reporting:
•the count of the alphabetic characters
•the count of the numeric characters
•the count of any other symbols. 
•the frequency of each character found in this input.   

Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user.
•Determine which row(s) of keys on a QWERTY keyboard need to be used to type this input

Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user. Analyze the vowel and consonant content of this input reporting:
•whether or not this input, in its entirety, comprises alternating vowels and consonants.

Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user and analyse its content, reporting:
• the length of the longest word and the length of the shortest word, along with the words.
•the word(s) that match the length of the longest word and the word(s) that match the length of the shortest word (duplicates aren't permitted).

Accept two words/phrases/sentences from the end user:
•determine if they are anagrams of each other.
  
Accept a word/phrase/sentence from the end user and analyse its content, reporting:
•whether the input is a palindrome. In this context, ignoring punctuation and capitalization, you should assume that there are two types of palindromes.
